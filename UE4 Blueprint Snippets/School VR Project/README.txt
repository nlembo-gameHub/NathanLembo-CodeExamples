For my VR project I have to make blueprints that my level designers and game designers can use and apply assets to or customize. For the snippets here I created a diorama table that will represent the school and each building has a U.I. widget that will display information fed into the variables of this object. Each object has its own set of information so that way multiple different information huds can be created and used.
