This section are examples of blueprint actors I have created and written. Many of my BPs are designed to be parent objects so that designers can create children of that BP and customize their elements where it's text, item comparisons, and meshes or images. The two projects in here are a captsone I worked on for school where I was creating puzzles using low-text and imagery to challenge the player. Teaching them and providing challenges to that information through puzzles. The second project is a VR project I am working on for my college for them to use for future promotion.
