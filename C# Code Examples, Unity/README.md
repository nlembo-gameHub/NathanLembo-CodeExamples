Unity Scripts, C#

Examples of Scripts I have written for my Unity Project "Nightmares" that I created for my Wake Technical Community College Capstone under the Simulation and Game Development Program, Summer of 2020. These scripts are ones I created for a group project and therefore are interacting with and accessing various objects and scripts in the game. Therefore, these scripts will not operate independently of that game unless re-written to do so.

The three main categories of scripting I operated in were A.I., Dialogue, and Cutscenes. I was the Project lead and also interact with other scripts and provided assistance, but these are scripts written by myself.
